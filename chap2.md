# Exercises

1.
a. Flexible better - Small number of predictors compared to sample size limits the negative effects of flexible system.

b. Worse - Flexible system will overfit with large number of predictors and small sample size

c. Better - Flexible system can adapt to non-linear system better

d. Worse - flexible systems will be strongly affected by the additional error during training 

2.
a. Regression  - inference
b. Classification - prediction
c. Regression - prediction

6. Parametric model uses fitting parameters with an assumed form of f.

Parametric models are highly intereptable compared to non-parametric models.

They may be limiting for complex forms of f and may not be capable of describing the system well.
